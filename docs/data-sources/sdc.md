# commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform apply --auto-approve

data "powerflex_sdc" "all" {

}

# Returns all sdcs
output "allsdcresult" {
  value = data.powerflex_sdc.all
}

// If multiple filter fields are provided then it will show the intersection of all of those fields.
// If there is no intersection between the filters then an empty datasource will be returned
// For more information about how we do our datasource filtering check out our guides: https://dell.github.io/terraform-docs/docs/storage/platforms/powerflex/product_guide/examples/
data "powerflex_sdc" "filtered" {
  filter {
    # id = ["ID1", "ID2"]
    # system_id = ["systemID", "systemID2"]
    # sdc_ip = ["SCDIP1", "SCDIP2"]
    # sdc_approved = false
    # on_vmware = false
    # sdc_guid = ["SdcGUID1", "SdcGUID2"]
    # mdm_connection_state = ["MdmConnectionState1", "MdmConnectionState2"]
    # name = ["Name1", "Name2"]
  }
}

# Returns filtered sdcs matching criteria
output "filteredsdcresult" {
  value = data.powerflex_sdc.filtered
}
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output by executing `terraform output` command. Also, we can fetch information via the variable: `data.powerflex_sdc.selected.attribute_name` where attribute_name is the attribute which user wants to fetch.
