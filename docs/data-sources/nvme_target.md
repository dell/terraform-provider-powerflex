# powerflex_nvme_target (Data Source)

This datasource is used to query the existing NVMe targets from the PowerFlex array. The information fetched from this datasource can be used for getting the details / for further processing in resource block.

> **Note:** 
  NVMe over TCP is supported in PowerFlex 4.0 and later versions, therefore this datasource is not supported in PowerFlex 3.x.

## Example Usage

```terraform

After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output by executing `terraform output` command. Also, we can fetch information via the variable: `data.powerflex_nvme_target.example1.datasource_block_name.attribute_name` where attribute_name is the attribute which user wants to fetch.
