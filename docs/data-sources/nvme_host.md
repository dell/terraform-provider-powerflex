# powerflex_nvme_host (Data Source)

This datasource is used to query the existing NVMe hosts from the PowerFlex array. The information fetched from this datasource can be used for getting the details / for further processing in resource block.

> **Note:** 
  NVMe over TCP is supported in PowerFlex 4.0 and later versions, therefore this datasource is not supported in PowerFlex 3.x.

## Example Usage

```terraform

# commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform apply --auto-approve

# Get all NVMe host details present on the cluster
data "powerflex_nvme_host" "example1" {
}


# if a filter is of type string it has the ability to allow regular expressions
# data "powerflex_nvme_host" "nvme_host_filter_regex" {
#   filter{
#     name = ["^System_.*$"]
#     system_id = ["^.*0f$"]
#   }
# }

# output "nvmeHostFilterRegexResult"{
#  value = data.powerflex_nvme_host.nvme_host_filter_regex.nvme_host_details
# }

// If multiple filter fields are provided then it will show the intersection of all of those fields.
// If there is no intersection between the filters then an empty datasource will be returned
// For more information about how we do our datasource filtering check out our guides: https://dell.github.io/terraform-docs/docs/storage/platforms/powerflex/product_guide/examples/ 
// Please note that NVMe over TCP is supported in PowerFlex 4.0 and later versions, therefore this datasource is not supported in PowerFlex 3.x.

data "powerflex_nvme_host" "example2" {
  filter {
    name = ["name1", "name2"]
    # id                = ["ID1", "ID2"]
    # nqn               = ["NQN1", "NQN2"]
    # max_num_paths     = [2]
    # max_num_sys_ports = [10]
    # system_id         = ["systemID"]
  }
}

output "nvme_host_result" {
  value = data.powerflex_nvme_host.example1.nvme_host_details
}
```

After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output by executing `terraform output` command. Also, we can fetch information via the variable: `data.powerflex_nvme_host.example1.datasource_block_name.attribute_name` where attribute_name is the attribute which user wants to fetch.
