  This datasource is used to read the Replication Pairs entity of the PowerFlex Array. This feature is only supported for PowerFlex 4.5 and above. An RCG is a collection of multiple replication pairs that need to be replicated together in a coordinated and consistent manner. The key purpose is to ensure that all the data within the group is replicated in a consistent state. Applies to a group of data that needs to be kept consistent across the source and target

An RCG is a collection of multiple replication pairs that need to be replicated together in a coordinated and consistent manner.

# commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform apply

// Empty filter block will return all the replication pairs
data "powerflex_replication_pair" "rp" {}
output "rpResult" {
  value = data.powerflex_replication_pair.rp
}

// If multiple filter fields are provided then it will show the intersection of all of those fields.
// If there is no intersection between the filters then an empty datasource will be returned
// For more information about how we do our datasource filtering check out our guides: https://dell.github.io/terraform-docs/docs/storage/platforms/powerflex/product_guide/examples/

  filter {
    # id = ["id", "id2"]
    # name = ["name-1", "name-2"]
    # remote_id = ["remote_id-1", "remote_id-2"]
    # user_requested_pause_transmit_init_copy = false
    # remote_capacity_in_mb = [8192]
    # local_volume_id = ["local_volume_id-1", "local_volume_id-2"]

  }
}
output "rpResultFiltered" {
  value = data.powerflex_replication_pair.rp_filter
}
```

After the successful execution of above said block, we can see the output by executing `terraform output` command. Also, we can fetch information via the variable: `data.powerflex_replication_pair.datasource_block_name.attribute_name` where datasource_block_name is the name of the data source block and attribute_name is the attribute which user wants to fetch.
