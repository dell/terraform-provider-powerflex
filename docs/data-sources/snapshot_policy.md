# powerflex_snapshot_policy (Data Source)

This datasource is used to query the existing snapshot policies from PowerFlex array. The information fetched from this datasource can be used for getting the details.

> **Note:** Only one of `name` and `id` can be provided at a time.

# commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform apply --auto-approve
# Reads snapshot policy either by name or by id , if provided
# If both name and id is not provided , then it reads all the snapshot policies
# id and name can't be given together to fetch the snapshot policy

data "powerflex_snapshot_policy" "sp" {

  #name = "sample_snap_policy_1"
  id = "896a535700000000"
}

output "spResult" {
  value = data.powerflex_snapshot_policy.sp.snapshotpolicies
}
```

After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output by executing `terraform output` command. Also, we can fetch information via the variable: `data.powerflex_powerflex_snapshot_policy.sp.attribute_name` where attribute_name is the attribute which user wants to fetch.
