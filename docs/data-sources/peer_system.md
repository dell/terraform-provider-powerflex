# commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform apply --auto-approve
# This feature is only supported for PowerFlex 4.5 and above.

# Get all Peer System details present on the cluster

# Get Peer System details using filter with all values
# If there is no intersection between the filters then an empty datasource will be returned
# For more information about how we do our datasource filtering check out our guides: https://dell.github.io/terraform-docs/docs/storage/platforms/powerflex/product_guide/examples

output "peer_system_result" {
  value = data.powerflex_peer_system.example1.peer_system_details
}
```

After the successful execution of above said block, We can see the output by executing `terraform output` command. Also, we can fetch information via the variable: `data.powerflex_peer_system.example1.attribute_name` where attribute_name is the attribute which user wants to fetch.
