# commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform apply --auto-approve

# Get all VTrees details present on the cluster
data "powerflex_vtree" "all" {
}

output "powerflex_vtree_all_result" {
  value = data.powerflex_vtree.all.vtree_details
}

# Get Peer System details using filter with all values
# If there is no intersection between the filters then an empty datasource will be returned
# For more information about how we do our datasource filtering check out our guides: https://dell.github.io/terraform-docs/docs/storage/platforms/powerflex/product_guide/examples
data "powerflex_vtree" "filtered" {
  filter {
    # storage_pool_id = ["storage_pool_id", "storage_pool_id2"]
    # data_layout = ["data_layout", "data_layout2"]
    # compression_method = ["compression_method", "compression_method2"]
    # in_deletion = false
    # name = ["name", "name2"]
    # id = ["id", "id2"]
  }
}

output "powerflex_vtree_filtered_result" {
  value = data.powerflex_vtree.filtered.vtree_details
}
```

After the successful execution of above said block, we can see the output by executing `terraform output` command. Also, we can fetch information via the variable: `data.powerflex_vtree.datasource_block_name.attribute_name` where datasource_block_name is the name of the data source block and attribute_name is the attribute which user wants to fetch.
