> After the successful execution of above said block, we can see the output by executing `terraform output` command. Also, we can fetch information via the variable: `data.powerflex_vtree.datasource_block_name.attribute_name` where datasource_block_name is the name of the data source block and attribute_name is the attribute which user wants to fetch.
