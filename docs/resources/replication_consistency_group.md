This resource is used to manage the Replication Consistency Group entity of the PowerFlex Array. This feature is only supported for PowerFlex 4.5 and above. We can Create, Update and Delete the PowerFlex Replication Consistency Group using this resource. We can also Import an existing Replication Consistency Group from the PowerFlex array.

  name     = var.destination_protection_domain_name
}

resource "powerflex_replication_consistency_group" "example" {
  provider = powerflex.source
  ### Required Values

  # New name of the Replication Consistency Group
  name = var.name
  # Protection domain on the source machine
  protection_domain_id = data.powerflex_protection_domain.source_protection_domain.protection_domains[0].id
  # Protection domain on the destination machine
  remote_protection_domain_id = data.powerflex_protection_domain.destination_protection_domain.protection_domains[0].id
  # Destination System ID
  destination_system_id = data.powerflex_protection_domain.destination_protection_domain.protection_domains[0].system_id

  ### Optional with defaults if unset

  # Must be greater the 15 or less then 3600 (seconds) Default: 15
  #rpo_in_seconds = 15
  # Sets the Active state, Options (Active, Terminated) Default: Active
  #local_activity_state = "Active"
  # Sets the Volume Access Mode, Options (NoAccess, ReadOnly) Default: NoAccess
  #target_volume_access_mode = "NoAccess"
  # Pause Mode, Options (Resume, Pause) Default: Resume
  #pause_mode = "Resume"
  # Freeze State, Options (Unfrozen, Frozen) Default: Unfrozen
  #freeze_state = "Unfrozen"
  # Current Consistency Mode, Options (Consistent, Inconsistent) Default: Consistent
  #curr_consist_mode = "Consistent"
}
```

After the execution of above resource block, the Replication Consistency Group will be created between the two Peer Systems. 
The user can then add Replication Pairs to the RCGs in order to replicate volumes between systems.
For more information, please check the terraform state file.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell

# import Replication Consistency Group by its id
terraform import powerflex_replication_consistency_group.example "<id>"
```

1. This will import the resource instance with specified ID into your Terraform state.
2. After successful import, you can run terraform state list to ensure the resource has been imported successfully.
3. Now, you can fill in the resource block with the appropriate arguments and settings that match the imported resource's real-world configuration.
4. Execute terraform plan to see if your configuration and the imported resource are in sync. Make adjustments if needed.
5. Finally, execute terraform apply to bring the resource fully under Terraform's management.
6. Now, the resource which was not part of terraform became part of Terraform managed infrastructure.
