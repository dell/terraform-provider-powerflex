# powerflex_protection_domain (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the Protection Domain entity of PowerFlex Array. We can Create, Update and Delete the protection domain using this resource. We can also import an existing protection domain from PowerFlex array.

> **Caution:** <span style='color: red;' >Protection Domain creation or update is not atomic. In case of partially completed create operations, terraform can mark the resource as tainted.
One can manually remove the taint and try applying the configuration (after making necessary adjustments).
If the taint is not removed, terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.</span>

## Example Usage

After the execution of above resource block, protection domain would have been created on the PowerFlex array. For more information, please check the terraform state file.

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Unique name of the protection domain instance.

### Optional

- `active` (Boolean) Whether the PD should be in `Active` state. Default value is `true`.
- `fgl_default_metadata_cache_size` (Number) Fine Granularity Metadata Cache size. Can be set only when `fgl_metadata_cache_enabled` is set to `true`.
- `fgl_metadata_cache_enabled` (Boolean) Whether Fine Granularity Metadata Cache is enabled or not.
- `overall_io_network_throttling_in_kbps` (Number) Maximum allowed IO for protected maintenance mode in KBps. Must be greater than any other network throttling parameter. The value `0` represents unlimited bandwidth. The default value is `0`.
- `protected_maintenance_mode_network_throttling_in_kbps` (Number) Maximum allowed IO for protected maintenance mode in KBps. The value `0` represents unlimited bandwidth. The default value is `0`.
- `rebalance_network_throttling_in_kbps` (Number) Maximum allowed IO for rebalancing in KBps. The value `0` represents unlimited bandwidth. The default value is `0`.
- `rebuild_network_throttling_in_kbps` (Number) Maximum allowed IO for rebuilding in KBps. The value `0` represents unlimited bandwidth. The default value is `0`.
- `rf_cache_enabled` (Boolean) Whether SDS Rf Cache is enabled or not. Default value is `true`.
- `rf_cache_max_io_size_kb` (Number) Maximum IO of the SDS RF Cache in KB. Can be set only when `rf_cache_enabled` is set to `true`.
- `rf_cache_operational_mode` (String) Operational Mode of the SDS RF Cache. Accepted values are `Read`, `Write`, `ReadAndWrite` and `WriteMiss`. Can be set only when `rf_cache_enabled` is set to `true`.
- `rf_cache_page_size_kb` (Number) Page size of the SDS RF Cache in KB. Can be set only when `rf_cache_enabled` is set to `true`.
- `vtree_migration_network_throttling_in_kbps` (Number) Maximum allowed IO for vtree migration in KBps. The value `0` represents unlimited bandwidth. The default value is `0`.

### Read-Only

- `fgl_default_num_concurrent_writes` (Number) Fine Granularity default number of concurrent writes.
- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the protection domain instance.
- `links` (Attributes List) Underlying REST API links. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--links))
- `replication_capacity_max_ratio` (Number) Maximum Replication Capacity Ratio.
- `rf_cache_accp_id` (String) ID of the RF Cache Acceleration Pool attached to the PD.
- `state` (String) State of the PD.

<a id="nestedatt--links"></a>
### Nested Schema for `links`

Read-Only:

- `href` (String) Specifies the exact path to fetch the details.
- `rel` (String) Specifies the relationship with the Protection Domain.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# /*

# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

# */

# import Protection Domain by it's id
terraform import powerflex_protection_domain.pd_data "<id>"
```

1. This will import the protection domain instance with specified ID into your Terraform state.
2. After successful import, you can run terraform state list to ensure the resource has been imported successfully.
3. Now, you can fill in the resource block with the appropriate arguments and settings that match the imported resource's real-world configuration.
4. Execute terraform plan to see if your configuration and the imported resource are in sync. Make adjustments if needed.
5. Finally, execute terraform apply to bring the resource fully under Terraform's management.
6. Now, the resource which was not part of terraform became part of Terraform managed infrastructure.
