# powerflex_nvme_target (Resource)

This resource is used to manage NVMe target from the PowerFlex array. We can Create, Update and Delete the PowerFlex NVMe target using this resource. We can also import an existing NVMe target from PowerFlex array.  
 **Note:** Either `protection_domain_id` or `protection_domain_name` must be specified.

> **Caution:** <span style='color: red;' >NVMe target creation or update is not atomic. In case of partially completed create operations, terraform can mark the resource as tainted.
One can manually remove the taint and try applying the configuration (after making necessary adjustments).
If the taint is not removed, terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.</span>

> **Note:** 
>  - Either `protection_domain_name` and `protection_domain_id` is required. But not both.
>  - NVMe over TCP is supported in PowerFlex 4.0 and later versions, therefore this resource is not supported in PowerFlex 3.x.
>  - To avoid potential issues, it is recommended to operate NVMe targets using the default ports.

## Example Usage

# Command to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply.
# Create, Update, Read, and Delete operations are supported for this resource.
# To import , check import.sh for more info.
# name and ip_list attributes are required, and either protection_domain_name or protection_domain_id must be specified.
# To check which attributes can be updated, please refer Product Guide in the documentation
# Please note that NVMe over TCP is supported in PowerFlex 4.0 and later versions, therefore this resource is not supported in PowerFlex 3.x.
# To avoid potential issues, it is recommended to operate NVMe targets using the default ports.

# Example for adding NVMe target.
resource "powerflex_nvme_target" "test-nvme-target" {
  name                   = "nvme_target_name"
  protection_domain_name = "demo-pd"
  ip_list = [
    {
      ip   = "10.10.10.13"
      role = "StorageAndHost" #StorageAndHost, StorageOnly, HostOnly
    },
    {
      ip   = "10.10.10.14"
      role = "StorageAndHost" #StorageAndHost, StorageOnly, HostOnly
    }
  ]
}
```

After the execution of above resource block, NVMe target would have been created on the PowerFlex array. For more information, please check the terraform state file.

<a id="nestedatt--ip_list"></a>
### Nested Schema for `ip_list`

Required:

- `ip` (String) NVMe Target IP.
- `role` (String) NVMe Target IP role.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell

# import NVMe target by its id
terraform import powerflex_nvme_target.nvme_target_import_by_id "<id>"
```

1. This will import the NVMe target instance with specified ID into your Terraform state.
2. After successful import, you can run terraform state list to ensure the resource has been imported successfully.
3. Now, you can fill in the resource block with the appropriate arguments and settings that match the imported resource's real-world configuration.
4. Execute terraform plan to see if your configuration and the imported resource are in sync. Make adjustments if needed.
5. Finally, execute terraform apply to bring the resource fully under Terraform's management.
6. Now, the resource which was not part of terraform became part of Terraform managed infrastructure.
