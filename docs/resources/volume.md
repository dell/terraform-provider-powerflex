# powerflex_volume (Resource)

This resource can be used to manage volumes on a PowerFlex array.

!> **Caution:** Volume creation or update is not atomic. In case of partially completed create operations, terraform can mark the resource as tainted.
One can manually remove the taint and try applying the configuration (after making necessary adjustments).
If the taint is not removed, terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.

~> **Note:** Exactly one of `protection_domain_name` and `protection_domain_id` and exactly one of `storage_pool_name` and `storage_pool_id` are required.

## Example Usage

```terraform

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the volume.
- `size` (Number) Size of the volume. The unit of size is defined by `capacity_unit`. The storage capacity of a volume must be a multiple of 8GB and cannot be decreased.

### Optional

- `access_mode` (String) The Access mode of the volume. Valid values are `ReadOnly` and `ReadWrite`. Default value is `ReadOnly`.
- `capacity_unit` (String) Unit of capacity of the volume. Must be one of `GB` and `TB`. Default value is `GB`.
- `compression_method` (String) Compression Method of the volume. Valid values are `None` and `Normal`.
- `protection_domain_id` (String) ID of the Protection Domain under which the volume will be created. Conflicts with `protection_domain_name`. Cannot be updated.
- `protection_domain_name` (String) Name of the Protection Domain under which the volume will be created. Conflicts with `protection_domain_id`. Cannot be updated.
- `remove_mode` (String) Remove mode of the volume. Valid values are `ONLY_ME` and `INCLUDING_DESCENDANTS`. Default value is `ONLY_ME`.
- `storage_pool_id` (String) ID of the Storage Pool under which the volume will be created. Conflicts with `storage_pool_name`. Cannot be updated.
- `storage_pool_name` (String) Name of the Storage Pool under which the volume will be created. Conflicts with `storage_pool_id`. Cannot be updated.
- `use_rm_cache` (Boolean) use rm cache
- `volume_type` (String) Volume type. Valid values are `ThickProvisioned` and `ThinProvisioned`. Default value is `ThinProvisioned`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the volume.
- `size_in_kb` (Number) Size in KB

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Below are the steps to import volume :
# Step 1 - To import a volume , we need the id of that volume 
# Step 2 - To check the id of the volume we can make use of volume datasource . Please refer volume_datasource.tf for more info.
# Step 3 - create a tf file with empty resource block . Refer the example below.
# Example :
# resource "powerflex_volume" "resource_block_name" {
# }
# Step 4 - execute the command: terraform import "powerflex_volume.resource_block_name" "id_of_the_volume" (resource_block_name must be taken from step 3 and id must be taken from step 2)
# Step 5 - After successful execution of the command , check the state file
# For volume resource, the user will not find the value for protection_domain_name, size attributes in the state file.
# For protection_domain_name and size, refer  GUI
```
