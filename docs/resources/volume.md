# powerflex_volume (Resource)

Manages Volume in powerflex.
Note: Volume creation or update is not atomic. In case of partially completed operations, terraform can mark the resource as tainted.
One can manually remove the taint and try applying the configuration (after making necessary adjustments).
Warning: If the taint is not removed, terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Command to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Create, Update, Delete is supported for this resource
# To import , check volume_resource_import.tf for more info
# To create / update, either storage_pool_id or storage_pool_name must be provided
# Also , to create / update, either protection_domain_id or protection_domain_name must be provided
# name, size is the required parameter to create or update
# other  atrributes like : capacity_unit, volume_type, use_rm_cache, compression_method, access_mode, remove_mode, sdc_list are optional 
# To check which attributes of the snapshot can be updated, please refer Product Guide in the documentation


resource "powerflex_volume" "avengers-volume-create" {

  protection_domain_name = "domain1"
  storage_pool_name      = "pool1" #pool1 have medium granularity
  size                   = 8
  use_rm_cache           = true
  volume_type            = "ThickProvisioned"

      limit_bw_in_mbps = 19
      access_mode      = "ReadOnly"
    },

- `capacity_unit` (String) capacity unit
- `compression_method` (String) Compression Method the volume.
- `protection_domain_id` (String) Protection Domain ID - Either of Protection Domain ID/Name is Required.
- `protection_domain_name` (String) Protection Domain Name - Either of Protection Domain ID/Name is Required.
- `remove_mode` (String) remove mode of Volume
- `sdc_list` (Attributes Set) mapped sdc info (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sdc_list))
- `storage_pool_id` (String) storage pool id - Either of Storage Pool ID/Name is Required.
- `storage_pool_name` (String) Storage Pool Name - Either of Storage Pool ID/Name is Required.
- `use_rm_cache` (Boolean) use rm cache
- `volume_type` (String) volume type

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the volume.

<a id="nestedatt--sdc_list"></a>
### Nested Schema for `sdc_list`

Optional:

- `access_mode` (String) The Access Mode of the SDC
- `limit_bw_in_mbps` (Number) limit bw in mbps
- `limit_iops` (Number) limit iops
- `sdc_id` (String) The ID of the SDC
- `sdc_name` (String) The Name of the SDC

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Below are the steps to import volume :
# Step 1 - To import a volume , we need the id of that volume 
# Step 2 - To check the id of the volume we can make use of volume datasource . Please refer volume_datasource.tf for more info.
# Step 3 - create a tf file with empty resource block . Refer the example below.
# Example :
# resource "powerflex_volume" "resource_block_name" {
# }
# Step 4 - execute the command: terraform import "powerflex_volume.resource_block_name" "id_of_the_volume" (resource_block_name must be taken from step 3 and id must be taken from step 2)
# Step 5 - After successful execution of the command , check the state file
# For volume resource, the user will not find the value for protection_domain_name, size attributes in the state file.
# For protection_domain_name and size, refer  GUI
```
