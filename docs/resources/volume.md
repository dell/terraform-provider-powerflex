# powerflex_volume (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the Volume entity of PowerFlex Array. We can Create, Update and Delete the volume using this resource. We can also import an existing volume from PowerFlex array.

> **Caution:** Volume creation or update is not atomic. In case of partially completed create operations, terraform can mark the resource as tainted.
One can manually remove the taint and try applying the configuration (after making necessary adjustments).
If the taint is not removed, terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.

> **Note:** Exactly one of `protection_domain_name` or `protection_domain_id` is required. Not both can be provided together. 
> **Note:** Exactly one of `storage_pool_name` or `storage_pool_id` are required. Not both can be provided together. 

## Example Usage

```terraform

# Command to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Create, Update, Delete is supported for this resource
# To import , check import.sh for more info
# name, size is the required parameter to create or update
# other  atrributes like : capacity_unit, volume_type, use_rm_cache, compression_method, access_mode, remove_mode are optional 
# To check which attributes of the volume can be updated, please refer Product Guide in the documentation

# Example for creating volume. After successful execution, volume will be created with 8 GB size.
resource "powerflex_volume" "avengers-volume-create" {
  name = "avengers-volume-create"

  # To create / update, either protection_domain_id or protection_domain_name must be provided
  protection_domain_name = "domain1"

  # To create / update, either storage_pool_id or storage_pool_name must be provided
  storage_pool_name = "pool1"

  # The unit of size of the volume is defined by capacity_unit whose default value is "GB".
  size          = 8
  capacity_unit = "GB" # GB/TB

  use_rm_cache = true
  volume_type  = "ThickProvisioned"      # ThickProvisioned/ThinProvisioned volume type
  access_mode  = "ReadWrite"             # ReadWrite/ReadOnly volume access mode
  remove_mode  = "INCLUDING_DESCENDANTS" # INCLUDING_DESCENDANTS/ONLY_ME remove mode
}
```

After the execution of above resource block, volume would have been created on the PowerFlex array. For more information, Please check the terraform state file.

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the volume.
- `size` (Number) Size of the volume. The unit of size is defined by `capacity_unit`. The storage capacity of a volume must be a multiple of 8GB and cannot be decreased.

### Optional

- `access_mode` (String) The Access mode of the volume. Valid values are `ReadOnly` and `ReadWrite`. Default value is `ReadOnly`.
- `capacity_unit` (String) Unit of capacity of the volume. Must be one of `GB` and `TB`. Default value is `GB`.
- `compression_method` (String) Compression Method of the volume. Valid values are `None` and `Normal`.
- `protection_domain_id` (String) ID of the Protection Domain under which the volume will be created. Conflicts with `protection_domain_name`. Cannot be updated.
- `protection_domain_name` (String) Name of the Protection Domain under which the volume will be created. Conflicts with `protection_domain_id`. Cannot be updated.
- `remove_mode` (String) Remove mode of the volume. Valid values are `ONLY_ME` and `INCLUDING_DESCENDANTS`. Default value is `ONLY_ME`.
- `storage_pool_id` (String) ID of the Storage Pool under which the volume will be created. Conflicts with `storage_pool_name`. Cannot be updated.
- `storage_pool_name` (String) Name of the Storage Pool under which the volume will be created. Conflicts with `storage_pool_id`. Cannot be updated.
- `use_rm_cache` (Boolean) use rm cache
- `volume_type` (String) Volume type. Valid values are `ThickProvisioned` and `ThinProvisioned`. Default value is `ThinProvisioned`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the volume.
- `size_in_kb` (Number) Size in KB
