# example 1: Service Resource
resource "powerflex_service" "service" {
  deployment_name        = "Test-Create-U1"
  deployment_description = "Test Service-U1"
  template_id            = "453c41eb-d72a-4ed1-ad16-bacdffbdd766"

# example 2: Get Template ID and Firmware ID from Template Datasource

data "powerflex_template" "template_data" {
  template_names = ["Teample_Name"]
}

resource "powerflex_service" "service" {
  deployment_name        = "Test-Create-U1"
