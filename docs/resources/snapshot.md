# powerflex_snapshot (Resource)

This resource can be used to manage snapshots of volumes on a PowerFlex array.

!> **Warning:** Snapshot creation or update is not atomic. In case of partially completed operations, terraform can mark the resource as tainted.
One can manually remove the taint and try applying the configuration (after making necessary adjustments).
If the taint is not removed, terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.

~> **Note:** Exactly one of `volume_name` and `volume_id` is required.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Create, Update, Delete is supported for this resource
# To import , check snapshot_resource_import.tf for more info
# To create / update, either volume_id or volume_name must be provided
# name is the required parameter to create or update
# other  atrributes like : access_mode, size, capacity_unit, lock_auto_snapshot, desired_retention, retention_unit, remove_mode, sdc_list are optional 
# To check which attributes of the snapshot can be updated, please refer Product Guide in the documentation

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the snapshot.

### Optional

- `access_mode` (String) The Access mode of snapshot. Valid values are `ReadOnly` and `ReadWrite`. Default value is `ReadOnly`.
- `capacity_unit` (String) Unit of capacity of the volume. Must be one of `GB` and `TB`. Default value is `GB`.
- `desired_retention` (Number) The minimum amount of time that the snapshot should be retained on the array starting at the time of apply. The unit is defined by `retention_unit`. Cannot be decreased.
- `lock_auto_snapshot` (Boolean) lock auto snapshot
- `remove_mode` (String) Remove mode of the snapshot. Valid values are `ONLY_ME` and `INCLUDING_DESCENDANTS`. Default value is `ONLY_ME`.
- `retention_unit` (String) Retention unit of the snapshot. Valid values are `hours` and `days`. Default value is `hours`.
- `sdc_list` (Attributes Set) List of SDCs to be mapped to the volume. Exactly one of `sdc_id` or `sdc_name` must be specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sdc_list))
- `size` (Number) Size of the snapshot. The unit of size is defined by `capacity_unit`. The storage capacity of a snapshot must be a multiple of 8GB and cannot be decreased.
- `volume_id` (String) The ID of the volume from which snapshot is to be created. Conflicts with `volume_name`. Cannot be updated.
- `volume_name` (String) The volume name for which snapshot is created. Conflicts with `volume_id`. Cannot be updated.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the snapshot.
- `retention_in_min` (String) retention of snapshot in min
- `size_in_kb` (Number) Size in KB

<a id="nestedatt--sdc_list"></a>
### Nested Schema for `sdc_list`

Optional:

- `access_mode` (String) The Access Mode of the SDC. Valid values are `ReadOnly`, `ReadWrite` and `NoAccess`. Default value is `ReadOnly`
- `limit_bw_in_mbps` (Number) Bandwidth limit in MBPS of the SDC. `0` represents unlimited IOPS. Default value is `0`.
- `limit_iops` (Number) IOPS limit of the SDC. Valid values are `0` or integers greater than `10`. `0` represents unlimited IOPS. Default value is `0`.
- `sdc_id` (String) The ID of the SDC. Conflicts with `sdc_name`. Cannot be updated.
- `sdc_name` (String) The Name of the SDC. Conflicts with `sdc_id`. Cannot be updated.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Below are the steps to import snapshot :
# Step 1 - To import a snapshot , we need the id of that snapshot 
# Step 2 - create a tf file with empty resource block . Refer the example below.
# Example :
# resource "powerflex_snapshot" "resource_block_name" {
# }
# Step 3 - execute the command: terraform import "powerflex_snapshot.resource_block_name" "id_of_the_snapshot" (resource_block_name must be taken from step 2)
# Step 4 - After successful execution of the command , check the state file
```
