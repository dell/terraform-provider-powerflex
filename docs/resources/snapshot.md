# powerflex_snapshot (Resource)

This resource can be used to manage snapshots of volumes on a PowerFlex array.

!> **Caution:** Snapshot creation or update is not atomic. In case of partially completed create operations, terraform can mark the resource as tainted.
One can manually remove the taint and try applying the configuration (after making necessary adjustments).
If the taint is not removed, terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.

~> **Note:** Exactly one of `volume_name` and `volume_id` is required.
In case of partial create/update operation, retention will not be set.

## Example Usage

```terraform

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the snapshot.

### Optional

- `access_mode` (String) The Access mode of snapshot. Valid values are `ReadOnly` and `ReadWrite`. Default value is `ReadOnly`.
- `capacity_unit` (String) Unit of capacity of the volume. Must be one of `GB` and `TB`. Default value is `GB`.
- `desired_retention` (Number) The minimum amount of time that the snapshot should be retained on the array starting at the time of apply. The unit is defined by `retention_unit`. Cannot be decreased.
- `lock_auto_snapshot` (Boolean) lock auto snapshot
- `remove_mode` (String) Remove mode of the snapshot. Valid values are `ONLY_ME` and `INCLUDING_DESCENDANTS`. Default value is `ONLY_ME`.
- `retention_unit` (String) Retention unit of the snapshot. Valid values are `hours` and `days`. Default value is `hours`.
- `size` (Number) Size of the snapshot. The unit of size is defined by `capacity_unit`. The storage capacity of a snapshot must be a multiple of 8GB and cannot be decreased.
- `volume_id` (String) The ID of the volume from which snapshot is to be created. Conflicts with `volume_name`. Cannot be updated.
- `volume_name` (String) The volume name for which snapshot is created. Conflicts with `volume_id`. Cannot be updated.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the snapshot.
- `retention_in_min` (String) retention of snapshot in min
- `size_in_kb` (Number) Size in KB

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Below are the steps to import snapshot :
# Step 1 - To import a snapshot , we need the id of that snapshot 
# Step 2 - create a tf file with empty resource block . Refer the example below.
# Example :
# resource "powerflex_snapshot" "resource_block_name" {
# }
# Step 3 - execute the command: terraform import "powerflex_snapshot.resource_block_name" "id_of_the_snapshot" (resource_block_name must be taken from step 2)
# Step 4 - After successful execution of the command , check the state file
```
