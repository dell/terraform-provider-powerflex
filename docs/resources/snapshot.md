# powerflex_snapshot (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the Snapshot of volumes on PowerFlex Array. We can Create, Update and Delete the snapshots using this resource. We can also import an existing snapshot from PowerFlex array.

> **Caution:** <span style='color: red;' >Snapshot creation or update is not atomic. In case of partially completed create operations, terraform can mark the resource as tainted.
One can manually remove the taint and try applying the configuration (after making necessary adjustments).
If the taint is not removed, terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.</span>

> **Note:** Either `volume_name` or `volume_id` is required. But not both.
<span style='color: red;' >In case of partial create/update operation, retention will not be set.</span>

## Example Usage

```terraform

# Commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Create, Update, Delete is supported for this resource
# To import , check snapshot_resource_import.tf for more info
# To create / update, either volume_id or volume_name must be provided
# name is the required parameter to create or update
# other  atrributes like : access_mode, size, capacity_unit, lock_auto_snapshot, desired_retention, retention_unit, remove_mode are optional 
# To check which attributes of the snapshot can be updated, please refer Product Guide in the documentation

# Example for creating snapshot with mandatory params. After successful execution, snapshot will be created of the same size as volume.
resource "powerflex_snapshot" "snapshots-create" {
  name      = "snapshots-create"
  volume_id = "4577c84000000120"
}

# Example for creating snapshot with optional params. After successful execution, snapshot will be created with the specified size.
resource "powerflex_snapshot" "snapshots-create-01" {
  name          = "snapshots-create-epsilon"
  volume_id     = "4577c84000000120"
  access_mode   = "ReadWrite" # ReadOnly/ReadWrite
  size          = 16
  capacity_unit = "GB" # GB/TB
  remove_mode   = "INCLUDING_DESCENDANTS" # INCLUDING_DESCENDANTS/ONLY_ME
}


# General guidlines for furnishing this resource block 
# resource "powerflex_snapshot" "snapshots-create-1" {
# 	name = "<snapshot name>"
# 	volume_name = "<volume name>"
# 	access_mode = "<access mode options are ReadOnly/ReadWrite, default value ReadOnly>"
# 	size = "<size[int] associated with capacity unit>"
# 	capacity_unit =  "<capacity unit options are gb/tb, default value gb>"
# 	lock_auto_snapshot = "<lock auto snapshot, snapshot which are created by snapshot policy can be locked.>"
# 	desired_retention = "<desired retention[int] associated with retention unit>"
# 	retention_unit = "<retention unit options are hours/days, default value hours>"
# 	remove_mode = "<remove mode options are ONLY_ME/INCLUDING_DESCENDANTS, default value ONLY_ME>"
# }
```

After the execution of above resource block, snapshot would have been created on the PowerFlex array. For more information, please check the terraform state file.

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the snapshot.

### Optional

- `access_mode` (String) The Access mode of snapshot. Valid values are `ReadOnly` and `ReadWrite`. Default value is `ReadOnly`.
- `capacity_unit` (String) Unit of capacity of the volume. Must be one of `GB` and `TB`. Default value is `GB`.
- `desired_retention` (Number) The minimum amount of time that the snapshot should be retained on the array starting at the time of apply. The unit is defined by `retention_unit`. Cannot be decreased.
- `lock_auto_snapshot` (Boolean) lock auto snapshot
- `remove_mode` (String) Remove mode of the snapshot. Valid values are `ONLY_ME` and `INCLUDING_DESCENDANTS`. Default value is `ONLY_ME`.
- `retention_unit` (String) Retention unit of the snapshot. Valid values are `hours` and `days`. Default value is `hours`.
- `size` (Number) Size of the snapshot. The unit of size is defined by `capacity_unit`. The storage capacity of a snapshot must be a multiple of 8GB and cannot be decreased.
- `volume_id` (String) The ID of the volume from which snapshot is to be created. Conflicts with `volume_name`. Cannot be updated.
- `volume_name` (String) The volume name for which snapshot is created. Conflicts with `volume_id`. Cannot be updated.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the snapshot.
- `retention_in_min` (String) retention of snapshot in min
- `size_in_kb` (Number) Size in KB

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# /*

# import Snapshot by it's id
terraform import powerflex_snapshot.ss_data "<id>"
```

1. This will import the snapshot instance with specified ID into your Terraform state.
2. After successful import, you can run terraform state list to ensure the resource has been imported successfully.
3. Now, you can fill in the resource block with the appropriate arguments and settings that match the imported resource's real-world configuration.
4. Execute terraform plan to see if your configuration and the imported resource are in sync. Make adjustments if needed.
5. Finally, execute terraform apply to bring the resource fully under Terraform's management.
6. Now, the resource which was not part of terraform became part of Terraform managed infrastructure.
