Manages Snapshot in powerflex.
Note: Snapshot creation or update is not atomic. In case of partially completed operations, terraform can mark the resource as tainted.
One can manually remove the taint and try applying the configuration (after making necessary adjustments).
Warning: If the taint is not removed, terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# Commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Create, Update, Delete is supported for this resource
# To import , check snapshot_resource_import.tf for more info
# To create / update, either volume_id or volume_name must be provided
# name is the required parameter to create or update
# other  atrributes like : access_mode, size, capacity_unit, lock_auto_snapshot, desired_retention, retention_unit, remove_mode, sdc_list are optional 
# To check which attributes of the snapshot can be updated, please refer Product Guide in the documentation

- `lock_auto_snapshot` (Boolean) lock auto snapshot
- `remove_mode` (String) remove mode of snapshot
- `retention_unit` (String) retention unit of snapshot
- `sdc_list` (Attributes Set) mapped sdc info (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sdc_list))
- `size` (Number) snapshot size
- `volume_id` (String) The volume id for which snapshot is created - Either of Volume ID/Name is Required.

<a id="nestedatt--sdc_list"></a>
### Nested Schema for `sdc_list`

Optional:

- `access_mode` (String) The Access Mode of the SDC
- `limit_bw_in_mbps` (Number) Bandwidth limit in mbps
- `limit_iops` (Number) IOPS limit

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Below are the steps to import snapshot :
# Step 1 - To import a snapshot , we need the id of that snapshot 
# Step 2 - create a tf file with empty resource block . Refer the example below.
# Example :
# resource "powerflex_snapshot" "resource_block_name" {
# }
# Step 3 - execute the command: terraform import "powerflex_snapshot.resource_block_name" "id_of_the_snapshot" (resource_block_name must be taken from step 2)
# Step 4 - After successful execution of the command , check the state file
```
