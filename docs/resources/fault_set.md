resource "powerflex_fault_set" "avengers-fs-create" {
  # Name of the fault set
  name = "avengers-fs-create2"

  # To create / update, protection_domain_id is required
  protection_domain_id = "202a046600000000"

# import fault set by it's id
terraform import powerflex_fault_set.fs_import_by_id "<id>"
```

1. This will import the fault set instance with specified ID into your Terraform state.
2. After successful import, you can run terraform state list to ensure the resource has been imported successfully.
3. Now, you can fill in the resource block with the appropriate arguments and settings that match the imported resource's real-world configuration.
4. Execute terraform plan to see if your configuration and the imported resource are in sync. Make adjustments if needed.
5. Finally, execute terraform apply to bring the resource fully under Terraform's management.
6. Now, the resource which was not part of terraform became part of Terraform managed infrastructure.
