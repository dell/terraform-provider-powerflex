# terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Create, Update, Delete is supported for this resource
# Import is supported.

# Example for creating user. After successful execution, user will be created with Monitor role. Below example works for PowerFlex version 3.6.
resource "powerflex_user" "newUser" {

  # name, role and password is the required parameter to create or update. Only role can be updated.
  name     = "terraform"
  role     = "Monitor" # Administrator/Monitor/Configure/Security/FrontendConfig/BackendConfig
  password = "Password"
}

# Example for creating user. After successful execution, user will be created with SystemAdmin role. Below example works for PowerFlex version 4.5.
resource "powerflex_user" "newUser" {

  # name, role and password is the required parameter to create or update. first_name and last_name are optional parameters in PowerFlex version 4.5.
  name     = "terraform"
  role     = "SystemAdmin" # Monitor/SuperUser/SystemAdmin/StorageAdmin/LifecycleAdmin/ReplicationManager/SnapshotManager/SecurityAdmin/DriveReplacer/Technician/Support
  password = "Password123@"
}

# Example for creating user. After successful execution, user will be created with LifecycleAdmin role. Below example works for PowerFlex version 4.6.
resource "powerflex_user" "test" {
  name       = "terraform"
  role       = "LifecycleAdmin" # Monitor/SuperUser/SystemAdmin/StorageAdmin/LifecycleAdmin/ReplicationManager/SnapshotManager/SecurityAdmin/DriveReplacer/Technician/Support
  password   = "Password123@"
  first_name = "terraform"
  last_name  = "terraform"
}
```

After the execution of above resource block, new user would have been created on the PowerFlex array. For more information, please check the terraform state file.

# */

# import user by it's id
terraform import powerflex_user.user_import_by_id "<id>"

# import user by it's id - alternative approach by prefixing it with "id:"
terraform import powerflex_user.user_import_by_id "<id:id_of_the_user>"

# import user by it's name
terraform import powerflex_user.user_import_by_name "<name:name_of_the_user>"
```

1. This will import the User instance with specified ID into your Terraform state.
2. After successful import, you can run terraform state list to ensure the resource has been imported successfully.
3. Now, you can fill in the resource block with the appropriate arguments and settings that match the imported resource's real-world configuration.
4. Execute terraform plan to see if your configuration and the imported resource are in sync. Make adjustments if needed.
5. Finally, execute terraform apply to bring the resource fully under Terraform's management.
6. Now, the resource which was not part of terraform became part of Terraform managed infrastructure.
