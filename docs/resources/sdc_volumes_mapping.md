# powerflex_sdc_volumes_mapping (Resource)

This resource can be used to manage mapping of volumes to an SDC on a PowerFlex array.

~> **Note:** Exactly one of `id` and `name` is required. Exactly one of `volume_id` and `volume_name` is required.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `id` (String) The ID of the SDC.
- `name` (String) The name of the SDC.
- `volume_list` (Attributes Set) List of volumes mapped to SDC. Atleast one of `volume_id` and `volume_name` is required. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--volume_list))

<a id="nestedatt--volume_list"></a>
### Nested Schema for `volume_list`

Optional:

- `access_mode` (String) The Access Mode of the SDC. Valid values are `ReadOnly`, `ReadWrite` and `NoAccess`. Default value is `ReadOnly`.
- `limit_bw_in_mbps` (Number) Bandwidth limit in MBPS. `0` represents unlimited bandwith. Default value is `0`.
- `limit_iops` (Number) IOPS limit. Valid values are 0 or integers greater than 10. `0` represents unlimited IOPS. Default value is `0`.
- `volume_id` (String) The ID of the volume.
- `volume_name` (String) The name of the volume.
