# Command to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Create, Update, Delete is supported for this resource
# To import, check import.sh for more info
# restricted_mode is the required parameter

resource "powerflex_system" "test" {
  restricted_mode = "Guid"
  sdc_approved_ips = [
    {
      id  = "sdc_id1"
      ips = ["sdc_ip1", "sdc_ip2"]
    },
    {
      id  = "sdc_id2"
      ips = ["sdc_ip3"]
    },
  ]
}
```

After the execution of above resource block, system would have been created on the PowerFlex array. For more information, please check the terraform state file.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# /*
# Copyright (c) 2024 Dell Inc., or its subsidiaries. All Rights Reserved.
# Licensed under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 (the "License");
# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

# */

# import system
terraform import powerflex_system.test ""

# Another way to import system using system ID
terraform import powerflex_system.test "system_id"
```

1. This will import the system instance with specified ID into your Terraform state.
2. After successful import, you can run terraform state list to ensure the resource has been imported successfully.
3. Now, you can fill in the resource block with the appropriate arguments and settings that match the imported resource's real-world configuration.
4. Execute terraform plan to see if your configuration and the imported resource are in sync. Make adjustments if needed.
5. Finally, execute terraform apply to bring the resource fully under Terraform's management.
6. Now, the resource which was not part of terraform became part of Terraform managed infrastructure.
