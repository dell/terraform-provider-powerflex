### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Placeholder

<a id="nestedatt--sdc_details"></a>
### Nested Schema for `sdc_details`

Optional:

- `ip` (String, Sensitive) IP of the node. Conflict with `sdc_id`
- `is_mdm_or_tb` (String) Whether this works as MDM or Tie Breaker,The acceptable value are `Primary`, `Secondary`, `TB`, `Standby` or blank. Default value is blank
- `is_sdc` (String) Whether this node is to operate as an SDC or not. The acceptable values are `Yes` and `No`. Default value is `Yes`.
- `name` (String) Name of the SDC to manage.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Below are the steps to import SDC :
# Step 1 - To import a sdc , we need the id of that sdc 
# Step 2 - To check the id of the sdc we can make use of sdc datasource . Please refer sdc_datasource.tf for more info.
# Step 3 - create a tf file with empty resource block . Refer the example below.
# Example :
# resource "powerflex_sdc" "resource_block_name" {
# }
# Step 4 - execute the command : terraform init && terraform import "powerflex_sdc.resource_block_name" "id_of_the_sdc" (resource_block_name must be taken from step 3 and id must be taken from step 2)
# Step 5 - After successful execution of the command , check the state file
```
