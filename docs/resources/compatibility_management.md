# Command to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply.

// Resource to manage lifecycle
resource "terraform_data" "always_run" {
  input = timestamp()
}

# Example for setting compatibility management. After successful execution, device will be added to the specified storage pool
resource "powerflex_compatibility_management" "test" {
  # Required Path on your local machine to your gpg file ie(/example/path/secring.gpg)
  repository_path = "/example/path/example.gpg"

  // This will allow terraform create process to trigger each time we run terraform apply.
  lifecycle {
    replace_triggered_by = [
      terraform_data.always_run
    ]
  }
}
