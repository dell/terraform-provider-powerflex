# powerflex_compatibility_management (Resource)

This resource is used to set the compatibility management from the PowerFlex array.

**Please consider the following points before using cluster resource.**

1. For PowerFlex 4.x, the PowerFlex Manager must be installed as a prerequisite. The required packages should be uploaded to the PowerFlex Manager.

2. For PowerFlex 3.x, a Gateway server is a prerequisite. The required packages should be uploaded to the gateway. The Package resource can be used for uploading packages to the gateway.

3. Support is provided for creating, importing, and deleting operations for this resource.

4. In multi-node cluster deployments, when some of the component installations fail, the partial deployment will not be rolled back.

5. If you've separately installed any SDR, SDS, or SDC and connected it to the cluster and if you face any security certificate issues during the destroy process, you'll have to manually accept the security certificate to resolve them.

6. During the destroy process, the entire cluster will be destroyed, not just specific individual resources. After destroy need to follow cleanup process.

7. `ips` attribute is used in minimal csv configuration whereas `mdm_ips` attribute is used in complete csv configuration.

8. For PowerFlex 4.x, there's no need to mention `allow_non_secure_communication_with_lia`, `allow_non_secure_communication_with_mdm`, and `disable_non_mgmt_components_auth`. And, **Rfcache** is not supported.

9. To follow the installation process, you can refer to the [Deployment Guide 3.x](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/scaleio/pfx_deploy_guide_3.6.x/deploy-powerflex?guid=guid-e9f70972-baac-42c9-9ff9-a3d2b0722f54&lang=en-us) & [Deployment Guide 4.x](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/scaleio/powerflex_install_upgrade_guide_4.5.x/introduction?guid=guid-e798f431-7df4-450c-8f86-60ee7f3d1e3e&lang=en-us)

# Command to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply.

// Resource to manage lifecycle
resource "terraform_data" "always_run" {
  input = timestamp()
}

# Example for setting compatibility management. After successful execution, device will be added to the specified storage pool
resource "powerflex_compatibility_management" "test" {
    # Required Path on your local machine to your gpg file ie(/example/path/secring.gpg)
    repository_path = "/example/path/example.gpg"
        
    // This will allow terraform create process to trigger each time we run terraform apply.
    lifecycle {
        replace_triggered_by = [
         terraform_data.always_run
        ]
    }
}
```

After the execution of above resource block, Cluster would have been created on the PowerFlex array. For more information, please check the terraform state file.
