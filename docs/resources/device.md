# powerflex_device (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the Device entity of PowerFlex Array. We can Create, Update and Delete the PowerFlex Devices using this resource. We can also import an existing device from PowerFlex array.

!> **Caution:** Device creation or update is not atomic. In case of partially completed create operations, terraform can mark the resource as tainted.
One can manually remove the taint and try applying the configuration (after making necessary adjustments).
If the taint is not removed, terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.

~> **Note:** Exactly one of `storage_pool_name` and `storage_pool_id` is required. Exactly one of `sds_name` and `sds_id` is required. 

## Example Usage

```terraform

# Command to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply.
# Create, Update, Read, Delete and Import operations are supported for this resource.
# To add device, device_path is mandatory along with storage_pool_name/storage_pool_id and sds_name/sds_id.
# Along with storage_pool_name, we have to specify protection_domain_id or protection_domain_name.
# To check which attributes of the device resource can be updated, please refer Product Guide in the documentation
