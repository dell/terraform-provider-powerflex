# powerflex_device (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the Device entity of PowerFlex Array. We can Create, Update and Delete the PowerFlex Devices using this resource. We can also import an existing device from PowerFlex array.

> **Caution:** <span style='color: red;' >Device creation or update is not atomic. In case of partially completed create operations, terraform can mark the resource as tainted.
One can manually remove the taint and try applying the configuration (after making necessary adjustments).
If the taint is not removed, terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.</span>

> **Note:** Either `storage_pool_name` or `storage_pool_id` is required. But not both. 

> **Note:** Either `sds_name` or `sds_id` is required. But not both.

> **Note:** If `storage_pool_name` is mentioned, we must specify either `protection_domain_id` or `protection_domain_name` but not both.

## Example Usage

# Command to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply.

# Example for adding device. After successful execution, device will be added to the specified storage pool
resource "powerflex_device" "test-device" {
  device_path            = "/dev/sdc"
  storage_pool_name      = "pool1"
  protection_domain_name = "domain1"
  sds_name               = "SDS_2"
  media_type             = "HDD" # HDD/SSD
}
```

After the execution of above resource block, device would have been created on the PowerFlex array. For more information, please check the terraform state file.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# /*

# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

# */

# import Protection Device by it's id
terraform import powerflex_device.device_data "<id>"
```

1. This will import the device instance with specified ID into your Terraform state.
2. After successful import, you can run terraform state list to ensure the resource has been imported successfully.
3. Now, you can fill in the resource block with the appropriate arguments and settings that match the imported resource's real-world configuration.
4. Execute terraform plan to see if your configuration and the imported resource are in sync. Make adjustments if needed.
5. Finally, execute terraform apply to bring the resource fully under Terraform's management.
6. Now, the resource which was not part of terraform became part of Terraform managed infrastructure.
