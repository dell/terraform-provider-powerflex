# powerflex_sds (Resource)

This resource is used to manage the Storage Data Servers entity of PowerFlex Array. We can Create, Update and Delete the SDS using this resource. We can also import an existing SDS from PowerFlex array.

> **Caution:** <span style='color: red;' >SDS creation or update is not atomic. In case of partially completed create operations, terraform can mark the resource as tainted.
One can manually remove the taint and try applying the configuration (after making necessary adjustments).
If the taint is not removed, terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.</span>

> **Note:** Either `protection_domain_name` and `protection_domain_id` is required. But not both.

## Example Usage

```terraform

# Commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Create, Update, Delete is supported for this resource
# To import , check sds_resource_import.tf for more info
# To create / update, either protection_domain_name or protection_domain_id must be provided
# name and ip_list are the required parameters to create or update
# other  atrributes like : performance_profile, port, drl_mode, rmcache_enabled, rfcache_enabled, rmcache_size_in_mb are optional 
# To check which attributes can be updated, please refer Product Guide in the documentation

# Example for adding SDS. After successful execution, SDS will be added to the protection domain.
resource "powerflex_sds" "create" {
  name                   = "demo-sds-test-01"
  protection_domain_name = "demo-sds-pd"
  ip_list = [
    {
      ip   = "10.10.10.12"
      role = "sdsOnly" # all/sdsOnly/sdcOnly
    },
    {
      ip   = "10.10.10.11"
      role = "sdcOnly" # all/sdsOnly/sdcOnly
    },
  ]
}

output "changed_sds" {
  value = powerflex_sds.create
}
```

After the execution of above resource block, sds would have been created on the PowerFlex array. For more information, please check the terraform state file.

## Schema

### Required

- `ip_list` (Attributes Set) List of IPs to be assigned to the SDS. There must be at least one IP with `all` role or at least two IPs, one with role `sdcOnly` and the other with role `sdsOnly`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ip_list))
- `name` (String) Name of SDS.

### Optional

- `drl_mode` (String) DRL mode of SDS
- `performance_profile` (String) Performance Profile of SDS. Valid values are `Compact` and `HighPerformance`. Default value is determined by array settings.
- `port` (Number) Port of SDS
- `protection_domain_id` (String) ID of the Protection Domain under which the SDS will be created. Conflicts with `protection_domain_name`. Cannot be updated.
- `protection_domain_name` (String) Name of the Protection Domain under which the SDS will be created. Conflicts with `protection_domain_id`. Cannot be updated.
- `rfcache_enabled` (Boolean) Rfcache enabled state of SDS
- `rmcache_enabled` (Boolean) Rmcache enabled state of SDS
- `rmcache_size_in_mb` (Number) Read RAM cache size in MB of SDS. Can be set only when `rmcache_enabled` is true.

### Read-Only

- `fault_set_id` (String) Fault set id of SDS
- `id` (String) The id of the SDS
- `is_on_vmware` (Boolean) Is on vmware state of SDS
- `mdm_connection_state` (String) Mdm connection state of SDS
- `membership_state` (String) Membership state of SDS
- `num_of_io_buffers` (Number) Number of io buffers of SDS
- `rmcache_frozen` (Boolean) RMcache frozen state of SDS
- `rmcache_memory_allocation_state` (String) Rmcache memory allocation state of SDS.
- `sds_state` (String) State of SDS

<a id="nestedatt--ip_list"></a>
### Nested Schema for `ip_list`

Required:

- `ip` (String) IP address to be assigned to the SDS.
- `role` (String) Role to be assigned to the IP address. Valid values are `all`, `sdcOnly` and `sdsOnly`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# /*

# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

# */

# import SDS by it's id
terraform import powerflex_sds.sds_data "<id>"
```

1. This will import the SDS instance with specified ID into your Terraform state.
2. After successful import, you can run terraform state list to ensure the resource has been imported successfully.
3. Now, you can fill in the resource block with the appropriate arguments and settings that match the imported resource's real-world configuration.
4. Execute terraform plan to see if your configuration and the imported resource are in sync. Make adjustments if needed.
5. Finally, execute terraform apply to bring the resource fully under Terraform's management.
6. Now, the resource which was not part of terraform became part of Terraform managed infrastructure.
