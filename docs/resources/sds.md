# powerflex_sds (Resource)

Manages SDSs in powerflex.
Note: SDS creation or update is not atomic. In case of partially completed operations, terraform can mark the resource as tainted.
One can manually remove the taint and try applying the configuration (after making necessary adjustments).
Warning: If the taint is not removed, terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.


## Example Usage

```terraform
# Commands to run this tf file : terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
# Create, Update, Delete is supported for this resource
# To import , check sds_resource_import.tf for more info
# To create / update, either protection_domain_name or protection_domain_id must be provided
# name and ip_list are the required parameters to create or update
# other  atrributes like : performance_profile, port, drl_mode, rmcache_enabled, rfcache_enabled, rmcache_size_in_mb are optional 
# To check which attributes can be updated, please refer Product Guide in the documentation

resource "powerflex_sds" "create" {
  name                   = "demo-sds-test-01"
  protection_domain_name = "demo-sds-pd"
  ip_list = [
    {
      ip   = "10.10.10.12"
      role = "sdsOnly"
    },
    {
      ip   = "10.10.10.11"
      role = "sdcOnly"
    },
  ]
}

output "changed_sds" {
  value = powerflex_sds.create
}
```

### Nested Schema for `ip_list`

Required:

- `ip` (String) IP address to be assigned to the SDS
- `role` (String) Role to be assigned to the IP address

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Below are the steps to import SDS :
# Step 1 - To import a sds , we need the id of that sds 
# Step 2 - To check the id of the sds we can make use of sds datasource . Please refer sds_datasource.tf for more info.
# Step 3 - create a tf file with empty resource block . Refer the example below.
# Example :
# resource "powerflex_sds" "resource_block_name" {
# }
# Step 4 - execute the command: terraform import "powerflex_sds.resource_block_name" "id_of_the_sds" (resource_block_name must be taken from step 3 and id must be taken from step 2)
# Step 5 - After successful execution of the command , check the state file
```
