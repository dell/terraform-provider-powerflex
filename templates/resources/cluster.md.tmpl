> **Note:**  Gateway server should be installed.

> **Note:** Support is provided for creating, importing, and deleting operations for this resource.

> **Note:** If during installation using a Gateway on one server, all binaries are successfully installed, but another server encounters issues during installation, there won't be any rollback function for the server where the installation was successful.

> **Note:** If any SDR, SDS, or SDC is installed separately and connected to the cluster, during the destroy process, if you encounter any security certificate issues, you will need to resolve them manually by accepting the security certificate.

> **Note:**  During the destroy process, the entire cluster will be destroyed, not just specific individual resources.

> **Note:** To follow the installation process, you can refer to the [Deployment Guide](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/scaleio/pfx_deploy_guide_3.6.x/deploy-powerflex?guid=guid-e9f70972-baac-42c9-9ff9-a3d2b0722f54&lang=en-us)
