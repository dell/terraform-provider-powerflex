{{ .Description | trimspace }}

**Please consider the following points before using cluster resource.**

1. For PowerFlex 4.x, the PowerFlex Manager must be installed as a prerequisite. The required packages should be uploaded to the PowerFlex Manager.

2. For PowerFlex 3.x, a Gateway server is a prerequisite. The required packages should be uploaded to the gateway. The Package resource can be used for uploading packages to the gateway.

3. Support is provided for creating, importing, and deleting operations for this resource.

4. In multi-node cluster deployments, when some of the component installations fail, the partial deployment will not be rolled back.

5. If you've separately installed any SDR, SDS, or SDC and connected it to the cluster and if you face any security certificate issues during the destroy process, you'll have to manually accept the security certificate to resolve them.

6. During the destroy process, the entire cluster will be destroyed, not just specific individual resources. After destroy need to follow cleanup process.

7. `ips` attribute is used in minimal csv configuration whereas `mdm_ips` attribute is used in complete csv configuration.

8. For PowerFlex 4.x, there's no need to mention `allow_non_secure_communication_with_lia`, `allow_non_secure_communication_with_mdm`, and `disable_non_mgmt_components_auth`. And, **Rfcache** is not supported.

9. To follow the installation process, you can refer to the [Deployment Guide 3.x](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/scaleio/pfx_deploy_guide_3.6.x/deploy-powerflex?guid=guid-e9f70972-baac-42c9-9ff9-a3d2b0722f54&lang=en-us) & [Deployment Guide 4.x](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-us/scaleio/powerflex_install_upgrade_guide_4.5.x/introduction?guid=guid-e798f431-7df4-450c-8f86-60ee7f3d1e3e&lang=en-us)

10. NVMe over TCP is supported in PowerFlex 4.0 and later versions, therefore SDT deployment is not supported in PowerFlex 3.x.

## Example Usage

{{- end }}

After the execution of above resource block, Cluster would have been created on the PowerFlex array. For more information, please check the terraform state file.

{{ if .HasImport -}}
## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

{{codefile "shell" .ImportFile }}

1. This will import the cluster instance using specified details into your Terraform state.
2. After successful import, you can run terraform state list to ensure the resource has been imported successfully.
3. Now, you can fill in the resource block with the appropriate arguments and settings that match the imported resource's real-world configuration.
4. Execute terraform plan to see if your configuration and the imported resource are in sync. Make adjustments if needed.
5. Finally, execute terraform apply to bring the resource fully under Terraform's management.
6. Now, the resource which was not part of terraform became part of Terraform managed infrastructure.
